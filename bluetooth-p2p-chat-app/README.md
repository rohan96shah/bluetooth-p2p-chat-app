# bluetooth-p2p-chat-app

### Description
Automate the process of sending a message using P2P from Laptop ‘A’ to Laptop ‘B’ and vice versa.

<ol>
  <li>Download bluecove-2.1.2.jar file.</li>
  <li>Open Netbeans</li>
  <li>Add the jar (zipped the file to the project’s run time and compile time.</li>
  <li>Create a new Java project called “Bluetooth”. After creating the project, the package name should be “bluetooth” and there should be    one class file called ‘Bluetooth.java’.</li>
  <li>Create two new java classes inside the same package - *SampleSPPClient.java* and *SampleSPPServer.java*.</li>
  <li>Copy the code from our files and paste it into the respective files created. For example, code from Bluetooth.java will be pasted    into class Bluetooth (which was created in step 2).</li>
  <li>Perform steps 1-4 on Laptop ‘B’.</li>
  <li>Turn on the bluetooth for Laptop ‘A’ and Laptop ‘B’ and pair the devices (i.e. make sure the two laptops are paired before performing step 7).</li>
  <li>Run the file ‘Bluetooth.java’ on both the laptops.</li>
</ol>

Note: I have implemented Random Number generator in the Bluetooth.java file that will generate Boolean values, that is 0 and 1. I am assuming that it will generate an equal number of 0’s and 1’s over a period of time.
